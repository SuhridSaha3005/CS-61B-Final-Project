# Build Your Own World Design Document

**Description**

We designed a Pacman-like game with user-interface elements. Using our knowledge of data structures and software engineering, we implemented features for selective lighting, avatar customization, saving/loading game status and our own ideas for game design. The avatar must move around in a randomly generated maze, escape from ghosts and ultimately collect 3 golden keys.

**Instructions**

Run ***Main.java*** to run the game
